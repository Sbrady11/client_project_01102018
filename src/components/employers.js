Today, candidates are going to be at an advantage over employers for the first time in hiring history; as recent laws have been passed by the government that affects the hiring and decision making compensation practices.

This will affect compensation practices, budgets, salaries, and limit your abilities to hire and compensate fairly across your current team. It may even waste your time from an interviewing standpoint.

Why??

Human Resource Departments and all Staffing Agencies that are involved in representing candidates for your singular openings will not be allowed by law to ask a candidate their current compensation.

ATP Options has the end to end staffing solutions /choices that will help you navigate through these challenging changes. Project Staffing will be the wave of the future just like Siri and cloud-based technology
